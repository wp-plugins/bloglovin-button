== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to log in to Bloglovin' or enter my username/password? =

Nope! This plugin won't request any details other than a link to your blog's profile on Bloglovin'.  You do not need to log in or give any private information.

= How do I display the button within my posts/pages? =

Once you have added your widget, you can then use the shortcode `[bloglovin_button]` to display it on any post/page. A common use for this would be to add the shortcode to the end of your posts so that people can easily follow after reading.

= Can I do anything else with the shortcode? =

Currently, you can change the color of the button by using the shortcode `[bloglovin_button color="COLOR HERE"]`. For example, to change the button to red, you would use `[bloglovin_button color="red"]` or for any other color `[bloglovin_button color="#d2d324"]`.

You can also embed the email signup form in any post/page by using the shortcode `[bloglovin_button email="true"]`.
